# Server Framework Documentation

This directory contains the Docusaurus documentation website for the server package.

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm start
```

This starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

Build the documentation site:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Serve

Serve the built site locally:

```bash
pnpm serve
```

This serves the built site from the `build` directory.
